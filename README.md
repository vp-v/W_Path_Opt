## Dynamic Pick Path Optimisation with ML-Based Picker Assignment

This project simulates a warehouse picking environment and demonstrates how
dynamic routing and machine learning can improve order picking efficiency.

### Key Features

- Graph-based dynamic pick path optimisation
- ML-driven picker assignment using Random Forest
- Performance comparison against static picking
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard

### Tech Stack

Python, NetworkX, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit

### Business Impact

- 20–30% reduction in travel distance (simulated)
- Improved picker utilisation
- Fairer performance evaluation
